NOTE: 



The theme chosen is a WordPress theme which is developed in a custom form so do not attempt to use it on WordPress. 

Host the website normally like you do on CPANEL through copying its contents in the CPANEL file manager. 



Suggested steps to Recover Your Website:


- Firstly, Extract the Website source files on your local system

- Choose a Go Daddy Hosting Plan (https://pk.godaddy.com/hosting)

- Transfer Domain "satrangstudio.com" from Hosterpk .com to Go Daddy (if this isn't possible, a new domain might have to be selected)

- On the CPanel which Go Daddy will provide you after purchase, upload all the website files through the file manager

-(Code is in plain HTML/CSS/JS, so further enhancements/modifications can be made easily to their files)




This codebase is a slightly older version of the site:

1. Logo has to be updated on Navbars

2. Backend code has to be written to send email from Contact Us form on Contact us Page
